The fulltests directory contains a variety of large SVG files that I've found in the wild (mostly from openclipart.org).

I use these files as a sort of real world sanity test (by visualling comparing the scoured output with the original).

When the unit tests build up to a respectable level this directory becomes less important in terms of verifying functionality but it will still help me retain a general sense of how well scour does its job in reducing filesize and complexity.
