Scour
=====

Scour will be a Python module that takes an input SVG and outputs a cleaner, 
more concise SVG file.  The goal will be that authors will use this script
after editing the file in a GUI editor such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.

Scour was started as a vehicle for me to learn Python.  In addition, the goal
is to reduce the amount of time I spend in cleaning up files I find on sites
such as openclipart.org
